The recreational activity is dangerous but if done under strict supervision, itâ€™s thrilling and adventurous.</p>
<p>Paragliding can be done solo and tandem at <strong>Bir-Billing in Kangra</strong> district. It is counted amongst the best paragliding sites anywhere in the world and is frequently picked for <strong>hosting the World Cup</strong> and other international competitions in the sport.</p>
<p>The rising hills of Billing provide amazing thermals that with a gush of moderate winds make for a good take-off with the landing being at the terraced grounds of Bir. Other delightful sites for paragliding in <strong>Himachal include Bandla Dhar near Bilaspur</strong> and <strong>Solang valley near Manali</strong>.</p>
<p>In solo paragliding, trained pilots fly alone in a paraglider, whereas in Tandem flights, a trained pilot tags an amateur guest along in his glider to have him experience the thrill of free flying. Tandem flights are what most enthusiasts love to indulge in.</p>
<p>For those wanting to take up the adventure sport,<strong> Himachal Tourism conducts training programmes at Bir and Dharamsala (Kangra).</strong></p>
<p>A new paragliding site is now available at <strong>Junga near Shimla in district Shimla</strong>, where adventure enthusiast can enjoy paragliding.</p>
