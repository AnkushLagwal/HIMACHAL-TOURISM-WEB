<strong><font size="8" color="gray">FAIR AND FESTIVEL OF KANGRA:</strong></font><br>
<br><hr>
<strong><font size="6" color="gray">1.Makar Sankranti :</strong><br> </font>It is made of Beas River.
 Although Makar Sankranti is an all-India festival it is celebrated a little differently in Kangra. It is said that Mata Barjeshwari got herself hurt while fighting the great Demon Mahishashura. To cure herself she applied ghee or clarified butter on her wound and it soon healed. During the Makar Sankranti a big fair is held at the Brajeshwari temple for seven days and special puja is also offered to the deity. Butter sculptures, flower decorations are as much part of the festivals as are holy dips at the Ban Ganga. Bhajans or hymns to the deity too add to gaiety.

<strong><font size="6" color="gray">2.Shivaratri and Navaratri :<br></strong></font> Shivaratri is another all-India festival celebrated little differently in Kangra. This festival is as much significant for the people here as for the temples of the town. While most keep fast throughout the day and offer their puja to Lord Shiva at night there is another unique aspect of it. Images of Lord Shiva and Mata Parbati are made either with clay or with cow dung. The idols are then worshiped with greatest devotion. Songs are also sung in praise of the lord Shiva and His Consort Mata Parbati. In all, Shivaratri is an example of a festival that combines devotion and piousness with gaiety.Navaratri is also another important all-India festival celebrated with gaiety in Kangra. Out of the nine days, the Durga Ashtami holds special significance for the people here. On that day devotees go to offer puja at the local Durga Temple.

Ten days prior to this festival seeds of five to seven different kinds of grains are mixed together and sowed in a basket filled with earth. It is either done by the head of the household or by the family priest. On the day of the Haryali clay idols of Shiva and Parbati are married off because the devotees believe that it is Their union, which causes fertility to the land.
