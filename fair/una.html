<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The Gurudwara is situated in Una town within the precinct of Una fort and was founded by the descendant of Baba Guru Nanak Dev Ji.</li>
<li>According to the District Gazetteer of Hoshiarpur (1884) Bedi Baba Kaladhari, a descendant of Baba Nanak, crossed over from Dera Baba Nanak (Gurdaspur), early in the 19th centuary and after wandering in the Jalandhar Doaba area for years, ultimately settled down at Una where he laid foundation of Una town.</li>
<li>Here he attracted huge crowd of followers who flocked to hear his eloquent disquisition on the Granth Sahib. In Samvat 1860 (1804 A.D.)</li>
<li>Raja Umed Singh gave to Baba Sahib Singh Ji Bedi, the whole of the Una Taluk (177 villages) as Jagir which was confirmed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in Samvat 1872 and about the same time he received Nurpur Taluka from Sardar Budha Singh.</li>
<li>Thus the principality of Bedi’s of Una went flourishing and expanding till it was taken over by the British.</li>
<li>Even Now the descendants of Baba Kaladhari live in the fort of Una. Every year in the month of February/March a fair is held here to commemorate the Baba Kaladhari.</li>
